# Attention-Based Deep Learning Architecture for Comprehensive Nucleic Acid-Binding Proteins Characterization

In this study, we developed a novel hierarchical and multi-class deep learning approach designed to effectively classify subtypes of NABPs (non-NABPs, RBPs, DSBs, and SSBs) with high precision
