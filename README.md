# Attention-Based Deep Learning Architecture for Comprehensive Nucleic Acid-Binding Proteins Characterization

In this study, we developed a novel hierarchical and multi-class deep learning approach designed to effectively classify subtypes of NABPs (non-NABPs, RBPs, DSBs, and SSBs) with high precision

# Files in /models:

non-NABP_NABP.h5: Pre-trained model for predicting Non-NABPs/NABPs.
DBP_RBP.h5: Pre-trained model for predicting DBPs/RBPs.
SSB_DSB.h5: Pre-trained model for predicting SSBs/DSBs.
Multi-class.h5: Pre-trained model for predicting Non-NABPs/RBPs/DSBs/SSBs.

# Dependencies:
Python/3.12.7
TensorFlow/2.18.0

# N.B: Please use .fasta file format to predict your desired sequence using our pre-trained models.
